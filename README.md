Web tool for interactive playing with Golang struct sizes.


## Aim
Provide comfortable tool to see how fields in struct are aligned,
to compare different structs and as the result - to understand
and remember alignment rules.

## Installing

```bas
go get -u github.com/butuzov/golang-sizeof
golang-sizeof
```

## Platform support
Tested on Linux and OS X x64 platforms, but should work properly and on other
*nix-like platforms. Should work on windows too, but i didn't test it, so can't confirm it.
